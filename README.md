# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview
In this module our goal was to use earthquake data in order to produce a map with multiple layers, a color scale to help differ between quakes, different sized radius determined by the magnitude of the earthquake, pop ups to give a brief description of the quake, along with an additional layer to the map using tectonic plates of the globe to help see location of different quakes. 

# Resources

1. Javascript
2. Leaflet
3. API's
4. GeoJSON


# Results 
Here are some of the images we created showing of the different laayers and themes of the maps. These images give a great representation of the items and goals listed in the above overview. 

1. Basic default image when information is loaded in from the challenge_logic.js and index.html pages

## Summary
This module was incredibly challenging to learn this for the first time, but wow is it rewarding to see what all we can create with the information that we can locate with open resources like used here. I do hope to continue to become more fluent in this coding language and hope to make further use of the information gathered from this module.
